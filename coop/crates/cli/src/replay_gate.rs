//! Offset-gated dedup for PTY replay streams.
//!
//! When a WebSocket client subscribes to `pty` events and requests `replay:get`,
//! there is a race window where broadcast PTY events cover the same byte range
//! as the replay response. Writing both to the terminal corrupts the display.
//!
//! `ReplayGate` tracks the highest committed byte offset and deduplicates
//! incoming Replay and Pty messages so each byte is written exactly once.
//!
//! The TypeScript mirror lives at `crates/web/src/lib/replay-gate.ts`.
//! Changes must be mirrored and both test suites must pass.

/// Action returned by [`ReplayGate::on_replay`].
